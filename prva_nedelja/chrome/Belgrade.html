    <p><b>Belgrade</b> is the capital and largest city in Serbia. <br>It is located at the confluence of the Sava and
        Danube rivers and the crossroads of the Pannonian Plain and the Balkan Peninsula.<br> Nearly 1.7 million people
        live within the administrative limits of the City of Belgrade.<br> It is the third largest of all cities on the
        Danube river.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>

    <h3>Prehistory</h3>
    <p>Chipped stone tools found in Zemun show that the area around Belgrade was inhabited by nomadic foragers in the
        Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras. Some of these tools are of Mousterian industry—belonging to Neanderthals
        rather than modern humans. Aurignacian and Gravettian tools have also been discovered near the area, indicating
        some settlement between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago</p>
    <h4>Antiquity</h4>
    <p><b><i>Evidence of early knowledge about Belgrade's geographical location comes from a variety of ancient myths
                and legends.</b></i> The ridge overlooking the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers, for example,
        has been identified as one of the places in the story of Jason and the Argonauts.[23][24] In the time of
        antiquity, too, the area was populated by Paleo-Balkan tribes, including the Thracians and the Dacians, who
        ruled much of Belgrade's surroundings.</p>

    <p>Belgrade lies 116.75 m (383.0 ft) above sea level and is located at the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers.
        The historical core of Belgrade, <em>Kalemegdan</em>, lies on the right banks of both rivers. Since the 19th
        century, the
        city has been expanding to the south and east; after World War II, New Belgrade was built on the left bank of
        the Sava river, connecting Belgrade with Zemun. Smaller, chiefly residential communities across the Danube, like
        Krnjača, Kotež and Borča, also merged with the city, while Pančevo, a heavily industrialised satellite city,
        remains a separate town. The city has an urban area of 360 km2 (140 sq mi), while together with its metropolitan
        area it covers 3,223 km2 (1,244 sq mi). On the right bank of the Sava, central Belgrade has a hilly terrain,
        while the highest point of Belgrade proper is Torlak hill at 303 m (994 ft). The mountains of Avala (511 m
        (1,677 ft)) and Kosmaj (628 m (2,060 ft)) lie south of the city. Across the Sava and Danube, the land is mostly
        flat, consisting of alluvial plains and loessial plateaus.Panoramic view of Belgrade city center seen from the
        Sava river. One of the characteristics of the city terrain is mass wasting. On the territory covered by the
        General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled
        as the 'high risk'. They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting.
        Downhill creeps are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the clay or loam soils, inclined between 7
        and 20%. Most critical ones are in Karaburma, Zvezdara, Višnjica, <strong>Vinča</strong> and Ritopek, in the
        Danube valley, and
        Umka, and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley.
    <blockquote>They have moving and dormant phases, and
        some of them have been recorded for centuries. </blockquote>Less active downhill creep areas include the entire
    Terazije
    slope above the Sava (Kalemegdan, Savamala), which can be seen by the inclination of the Pobednik monument and
    the tower of the Cathedral Church, and the Voždovac section, between Banjica and Autokomanda.<q

        land
        movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst
        pipes, etc.). The neighbourhood of Mirijevo is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the
        problem. During the construction of the neighbourhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved
        and the movement of the land is today completely halted.[115][116]</p>
