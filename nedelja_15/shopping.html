        In your IDE of choice, create a new JavaScript file named shopping.js
        and make it so that all code written in the file follows strict mode.
        Also try to implement error handling as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create an anonymous immediately-invoking function that will hold the
        main execution of all program calls. Writing a simple command
        console.log(“Hi”) inside this function and running the code should
        output “Hi“ in the console.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create constructor functions with properties representing the following
        “things”:<br />
        <i>Product</i> - product id (random number of 5 digits generated on
        every product creation), name, price (with 2 decimal places), expiration
        date<br />
        <i>ShoppingBag</i> - a list of products (initially empty; function
        constructor does not have any input parameters)
      </p>

      <p>
        Add <i>getInfo</i> method to Product. It should return a formatted
        string containing product code (the first and last letter of the name
        together with the product id), name and price. <br />"Banana" ->
        BA32784, Banana, 129.31
      </p>

      <p>
        Add <i>addProduct</i> method to ShoppingBag. It should receive a Product
        and add it to the product list. You can add a product to the list only
        if it has a valid expiration date.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add a method to ShoppingBag that calculates the average product price of
        products in your product list and prints out this value with the
        precision of three decimals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add <i>getMostExpensive</i> method that finds the most expensive product
        and prints out its info.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add <i>calculateTotalPrice</i> method to ShoppingBag that calculates the
        total price of products in the shopping bag list.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create a constructor function with properties representing the
        following: <br /><br />PaymentCard - account balance (number with 2
        decimal places), active or inactive status, valid until date
      </p>
      <p>
        Create checkoutAndBuy function which receives shopping bag and payment
        card and prints if the purchase is successful or not.<br /><br />
        Purchase is successful only if the amount on the card is greater or
        equal to the total price of products in the shopping bag. If there is
        not enough money, print out the amount that is missing to complete the
        purchase.
